# ERROR Handling
# Difference between Syntax Error and Exceptions
# TRY and EXCEPT Statement â€“ Catching Exceptions
# Try and except statements are used to catch and handle exceptions in Python. Statements that can raise exceptions are kept inside the try clause and the statements that handle the exception are written inside except clause.

# amount = 10000
# if(amount > 2999):
#     print("You are eligible to purchase the goods")

# Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

# zeroDivisionError
# score = 100
# average = score / 0
# print(average)    #will raise zeroDivisionError 
# try :
#     average =  score/0
# except:
#     print("Cant divide an integer by zero")

# Type error

x = 5
y = "6"
# z = x + y
# print(z)
try :
    z = x + y
except TypeError:
    print("Cant add an int to a string")

# catching the error
# x = 5
# y = "6"
# try:
#     z = x + y
# except TypeError:
#     print("Error: cannot add an int and a str")


# IndexError

num = [1, 2, 3]
try: 
    print ("Second element = %d" %(num[1]))   #%d is a placeholder to collect  the index (as decimal) coming from num and %(a[1]) is called formatting

    print ("Fourth element = %d" %(num[3]))

except IndexError:
    print ("index out of range")
